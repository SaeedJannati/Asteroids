# Asteroids
*When you are testing the game in the editor please pay attention so that astroid are not visible in the scene view. Beacuse of the usage of the isVisible 
property of astroid renderers even if they are visible to scene view camare the movmenet system won't work properly.

* There are several scriptable objects created so that the designer can tweak different values of different systems some examples are:
PlayeInputModel: you can change the input system of the game by changing platfrom of this object. You can either choose mobile input (DPAD and etc...) 
or PC (keyboard)
PlayerHealthModel: you canv change the amount of max health of player and couple of other things from here
* By searching "Model" in the project window you can find several other models aswell that you can change.
